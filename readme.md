## State Management

The project utilizes Zustand for state management. Zustand provides a simple and performant way to manage state in a React application. The state related to the selected rating and other UI interactions is managed using Zustand, ensuring a clean and predictable state management approach.

## Styling

The project uses Sass for styling, which allows for modular and maintainable stylesheets. The `_variables.scss` file contains global variables used for consistent theming and styling throughout the application.

## Code Quality

The project follows clean code principles to ensure readability, maintainability, and scalability. The codebase is structured in a modular manner, with reusable components and utility functions. Proper type annotations using TypeScript enhance code robustness and readability.
